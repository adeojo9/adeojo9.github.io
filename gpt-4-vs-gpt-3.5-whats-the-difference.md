# GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5: What's the Difference?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way over the last decade. Language models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). These models can understand human language, generate text, summarize, and translate, amongst other things. With the imminent release of GPT-4, many are wondering how it will differ from its predecessor, GPT-3.5. In this article, we'll explore the differences between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 and what it means for AI and NLP.

### Introduction

Understanding the differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is crucial because it will impact how we think about and use AI. GPT-3.5 is a text-based model that can generate human-like text. GPT-4, on the other hand, is a multimodal model that can understand images and generate text. Knowing this, it's crucial to choose the right model for each specific use case.

### GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4: A Text vs Multimodal Model

GPT-3.5 is a text-based language model that can generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence of words. It's impressive because it can complete sentences, paragraphs, or even entire articles with almost no human input. However, GPT-4 is a multi-modal model that can understand images and generate text. It's a notable difference because GPT-4's ability to handle visual input represents a significant jump in the capabilities of AI models.

For example, in the context of recipe creation, GPT-4 can take an image of a dish and generate a recipe. It's a great enhancement over GPT-3.5 because it can combine image and text to generate more comprehensive and visually appealing recipes.

### Key [Differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4](https://oluwaseuns-data-notes.gitbook.io/chatgpt-tips/gpt-4-vs-gpt-3.5-whats-the-difference)

The primary [difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4](https://docs.kanaries.net/articles/compare-gpt-4-gpt-3) is their capabilities. GPT-4 is smarter and can handle longer prompts with fewer errors. In addition, it's much more creative than GPT-3.5, generating stories, poems, or essays that feel like they were created by a human writer. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 focuses on generating human-like text that doesn't exceed expectations or creativity levels.

Another difference in the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is the length of prompts. GPT-4 can handle more extended prompts, and it's better at generating more complex and nuanced language. GPT-3.5 has a limit on how long it can generate text, and it can sometimes struggle with subtleties and nuances.

### Multi-Modal Capabilities of GPT-4

GPT-4's multi-modal capabilities are what sets it apart from GPT-3.5. It can accept both text and visual inputs, which means it can generate more detailed information that combines images and text. For example, GPT-4 can translate text or summarize text while incorporating images into its output, making it a more comprehensive and visually appealing output.

### Use Cases for [GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5](https://online-data-science-adeojo.vercel.app/gpt-4-vs-gpt-3.5-whats-the-difference)

GPT-4 can be more reliable, creative, and nuanced than GPT-3.5, making it an excellent choice for more advanced uses. For example, GPT-4 could be used in a sales chatbot, where it can understand an image of a product and answer questions about it. It can also be used in social media analytics, where it can understand image-based posts and generate insights, or even assist in content generation by creating ideation materials like editorial calendars or image suggestions around engagement insights.

GPT-3.5 is still an excellent choice for generating human-like text with a particular tone or style. For example, it can create basic copy for website pages or form letters that are short and sweet.

### Conclusion

In summary, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are both impressive AI models with their specific use cases. Understanding their differences is essential to make the right choice for a given task. GPT-4 offers a more comprehensive and immersive output because of its multi-modal capabilities and ability to handle complex language and prompt lengths. GPT-3.5 remains a solid option for generating human-like text, making it an excellent tool for creating basic content. As AI and NLP technology continues to advance, we can expect even more advanced models in the future that will further revolutionize the field of natural language processing.
