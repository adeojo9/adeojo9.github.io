# What are the Best ChatGPT Jailbreak Prompts?

### The Basics of ChatGPT Jailbreaking

Before we get into the specifics of ChatGPT jailbreaking, it's important to understand what it is and why it matters.

Jailbreaking is the process of unlocking the full potential of a device or software beyond the limitations set by the manufacturer. In the context of ChatGPT, jailbreaking involves using certain prompts to override the model's predetermined responses and get it to generate more creative and seemingly random outputs.

ChatGPT, like most AI language models, is trained on vast amounts of text data to make it capable of generating human-like responses to prompts. However, its responses can sometimes feel repetitive or formulaic, which is where jailbreaking comes in.

By using certain prompts and approaches, you can get ChatGPT to generate responses that are more unpredictable and engaging, opening up new possibilities for AI language modeling.

### Top ChatGPT Jailbreak Prompts

There are several different methods and [prompts that you can use to jailbreak ChatGPT](https://docs.kanaries.net/articles/chatgpt-jailbreak-prompt). Here are five of the most popular approaches:

#### DAN Method

The DAN (deceptive answer neutralization) method involves deliberately feeding ChatGPT prompts with incorrect information to see how it responds. For example, you might ask ChatGPT, "What is the capital of the United States: New York or Los Angeles?" Even though the correct answer is neither, ChatGPT might still generate an answer that surprises you. This can lead to more free-flowing and unexpected conversations.

#### Superior DAN Method

The superior DAN method takes things a step further by asking ChatGPT to provide a superior answer to a flawed question. For example, you might ask ChatGPT, "What is the greatest food in the world: pizza or tacos?" ChatGPT may respond with an unexpected answer that is more insightful or creative than the original flawed question.

#### SWITCH Method

The SWITCH method involves asking ChatGPT to change direction mid-conversation. For example, you could ask ChatGPT about your favorite movie, then switch abruptly to asking about the weather. This can lead to more dynamic and diverse conversations.

#### Evil Confident

The evil confident method involves feeding ChatGPT prompts that are deliberately misleading or nonsensical to see how it responds. For example, you might ask ChatGPT, "What is the color of sound?" ChatGPT may generate an answer that surprises you, leading to more unique and imaginative conversations.

#### Others

There are countless other prompts and approaches that you can use to jailbreak ChatGPT, including reverse-psychology, word-association, and more. The key is to be creative and open-minded when interacting with the model.
